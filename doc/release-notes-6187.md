## Devnet Breaking Changes

`BRR` (`realloc`), `DIP0020`, `DIP0024`, `V19`, `V20` and `MN_R` hardforks are activated at block 2 instead of block 300 on devnets now. Please note that this is a breaking change so you will no longer be able to sync on devnets created with earlier Dash Core versions and vice versa.
